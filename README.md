# EMF Software Development Kit (SDK)

The EMF SDK empowers developers to seamlessly integrate AI models into their applications with ease and efficiency.

## Works Best with EMF CLI

For optimal usage and seamless integration, the EMF SDK works best 
alongside the [EMF Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://github.com/easy-model-fusion/emf-cli). It includes the EMF SDK and provides a convenient interface for managing models, configuring development environments, and deploying applications.
